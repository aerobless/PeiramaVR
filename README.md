# Sky Inn VR

In Sky Inn VR you're waking up on a floating island with a derelict inn. The game revolves around discovering the secrets of the inn, getting it back in shape and serving
food to customers. Occasionally even mischievous sky goblins may attack the inn in the search for food.

The game is loosely inspired by the excellent web series [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/).

## Running the game
Once the first basic game loop is complete the game will be release on Meta App Lab for the [Meta Quest 2](https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/). I'll probably also create a PCVR version for itch.io.

## Development stack
I'm using close to the latest version of Unity (atm 2021.1) as the game engine. For VR support I'm using the oculus integration as well as the HurricaneVR plugin.
To create active ragdoll NPCs I'm using the PuppetMaster plugin. Code is programmed in C# using JetBrains Rider. To create 3D and 2D art I'm using blender and gimp.

Some more VR development insights, links and notes can be found on my [personal wiki](https://wiki.sixtymeters.com/virtual-reality/vr-development)

## Roadmap
A rough roadmap can explored on my [notion project board](https://sixtymeters.notion.site/57991e512518419392db40dd16d27676?v=a7351d71598040088497a639a5fca47f). Since this is a hobby
project I'm spending time on the stuff that's fun to create and not necessarily the most important ;-).

## Can I clone this project & build it myself?
Probably no. When creating this repo I've excluded third party assets and plugins. Since this project relies heavily on the plugins HurricaneVR and PuppetMaster you would
need to buy at least those two plugins to get it running.
